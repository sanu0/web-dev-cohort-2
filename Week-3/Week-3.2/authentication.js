//  Project for today
//  Let people sign up to your website. Only allow signed in users to see people
//  (create a dummy people list)
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**So if you visit out website then it has some content to it.
 * But the content can only be seen by the signed in users. Our website will provide
 * a field to sign in with user and password and only signed in users will be allowed
 * to accesd and look at the content of the website.
 * It is somewhat similar to fakerapi, as we have done before but only with authentication.
