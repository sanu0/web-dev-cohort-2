/**
 * For frontend we create a frontend folder.So for it go to the root folder and then run the cmd 
 * "npm create vite@latest"
 * Give the project name : frontend
 * choose react and then javascript
 * 
 * and that should initialize an empty react project in the frontend folder
 *  
 * We run 'npm install' in the frontend folder so that we have all the dependencies on the frontend folder.
 * It will also have it's own node-module.
 * 
 * After that we clear all the css files and clear out all the jargons that is pre written in the App.jsx file
 * Now here we can retuen just a div with hi there written in it and with running 'npm run dev' command we can get the link which we can click and see the 
 * project results
 * 
 * No we create a component file where we gonna create the html components.
 * The first thing we do here is that we create a CreateTodo.jsx file here
 * Notice that the jsx file should start from the capital letter an end with .jsx extension!
 *
